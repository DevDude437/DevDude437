## Hi there 👋 I'm DevDude437!

I know some Python and HTML. My home is in the Command Line. a GUI is way too easy! I like Linux and GrapheneOS. Also FOSS stuff. I enjoy coding when when I have a moment to spare. I hope to make some FOSS apps eventually. Don't know when that will be, but keep checking back to see!
